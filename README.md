### Hi, I'm Moeed (I go by my last name) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD candidate in Oliver Stegle's machine learning group at Heidelberg University. I have a Master's degree in Computer Science from TU Munich and a Bachelor's degree in the same from NUST, Pakistan.
Previous projects have included representation learning for gene expression (master's thesis under Fabian Theis), domain transfer for reinforcement learning with [TUM Data Innovation Lab](https://www.di-lab.tum.de/tum-di-lab/), text summarization using transformer models and classifying motor signals via EEG.

I also work part-time as an AI engineer at [appliedAI](https://www.appliedai.de/), currently investigating classifier calibration.

My interests include:
- Causal inference and discovery
- Reinforcement learning
- Interpretable and reliable machine learning

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: Representation learning for gene expression.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: Causal inference, Gaussian processes.
